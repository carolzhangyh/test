## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

###### Q 1######
##a
```{r}
setwd("C:/Users/carol/Desktop/stat350")
prestige <- read.csv("prestige.csv")

lm <- lm(prestige ~ education+income+type, data=prestige)
summary(lm)
anova(lm)


reduce_type <- lm(prestige ~ education+income, data=prestige)
anova(reduce_type, lm) #p-value 1.208e-06 is small, "type" is good

reduce_income <- lm(prestige ~ education+type, data=prestige)
anova(reduce_income, lm) #p-value 5.124e-08 is small, "income" is good

reduce_education <- lm(prestige ~ income+type, data=prestige)
anova(reduce_education,lm) #p-value 0.004164 is small, "education" is good

```
#Ho: B1=B2=B3=0
#Ha: at least one of those factors is not equal to 0.
#p-value: < 2.2e-16
#Conclution: reject Ho. all of three factors are significant.


##b
```{r}
plot(lm, which=c(1,2,5))
prestige[c(6,28,33),]
```
##6(minister),28(machinist),33(motorman) are outliers. obviously differential
##17, 27 only have high leverage, but small coke distance.Therefore, we can classify them as not differential.


##c
```{r}
install.packages("MASS")
library(MASS)
rr.lm <- rlm(prestige~education+income+type,  data=prestige,psi=psi.huber)
summary(rr.lm)
rr.lm$w
```

#Yes. They are all significant.

##d
```{r}
rr.lm$w
plot(rr.lm$w, col=6,ylab="weights")

which(rr.lm$w == min(rr.lm$w))
prestige$X[6]
```
#Minister(6-th) is the smallest.



###### Q2 ######

###a
```{r}
setwd("C:/Users/carol/Desktop/stat350")
assign6 <- read.csv("assignment6.csv")
lm_Q2 <- lm(y~x, data=assign6)
summary(lm_Q2)$coef

```
#y= 49.85x -9.07

###b
```{r}
plot(lm_Q2, which=c(1,2,5))
```

##It is uncomfortable as there are many outliers shown by residual plot. The distribution is not normal shown by QQ plot, and there are some variables with large coke's distance.

###c
```{r}
install.packages("MASS")
library(MASS)
rr.lmQ2 <- rlm(y~x, data=assign6, psi=psi.huber)
rr.lmQ2
```
#y=69.74x -2.95

###d
```{r}
plot(assign6$x,assign6$y, col="grey", xlab="x",ylab="y", main="")
abline(lm_Q2, col="green")
abline(rr.lmQ2,col="purple")
```
## The purple line (robest regression) is better.


###e
```{r}
install.packages("MASS")
library(MASS)
index= sample.int(1050, size=1050, replace=TRUE)
rlm(y~x, psi=psi.huber, data=assign6[index,])$coef[2]

slope<- NULL

set.seed(666)
for(i in 1:1000){
  index = sample.int(1050, size=1050, replace=TRUE)
  slope[i]= rlm(y~x, psi=psi.huber,data=assign6[index,])$coef[2]
}

hist(slope, col="dark green")
```
#estimated slope is 70.

###f
```{r}
quantile(slope, probs=c(0.025,0.975))
```
#The CI is (67.3,71.7)

###g
#H0:slope=0
#Ha: slope is not equal to 0
#95% CI(67.3, 71.7) does not contain zero, so reject H0. Therefore, we can conslude that the slope is different than zero at 0.5% significant level.
